----------
Planned:

Volumetric Lights
Bloom
SSS (Sub Surface Scattering)
revisit SSR (for roughness support and physical correctness)
DoF (Depth of Field) + Bokeh 
Motion Blur (could be annoying)
Specular and Specular Tint Textures
Ansiotropic (IBL and SSS)
Cleancoat / Glossy
Emission
Redo shadow mapping with atlas depth maps
Cascaded shadow mapping

-----------

Work in progress:

Texture sharing between materials
Reintegrate Physics engine
Assimp scene import
Shadow mapping!!!
Editor
Project import
Scene serialization


-----------
Done/Optimization/"Working" Stage:

Deferred Shading
Directional lights, Point/Omni lights, Spotlights
PBR (Physically Based Rendering) and IBL (Image Based Lightning) (direct and indirect: diffuse, specular lightning)
SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occulusion)
HBAO (Horizon Based Ambient Occulusion)
FXAA (Fast approximate anti-aliasing)
SSR (Screen Space Reflections)
