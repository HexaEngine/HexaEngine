</p>

A work in progress Game Engine written in C#, aiming for high performance and cross-platform compatibility (currently only Windows). It incorporates SIMD optimizations and multithreading throughout. The engine adopts an ECS-like approach but with unique twists to enhance flexibility and performance.
